# Welcome to Defold

This project was created from the "basic 3D" project template.

The settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) are mostly set to the default values. The ["rendercam"](https://github.com/rgrams/rendercam) extension added as a dependency, and the project render script is set to the render script included in that extension. Physics is set to 3D and not 2D, which is the default value.

The project includes a bootstrap ["main.collection"](defold://open?path=/main/main.collection) that references a camera object from the rendercam extension.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs.

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
